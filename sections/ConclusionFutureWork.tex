\section{Conclusion and future work}

Visualizing large trajectory dataset is challenge due to two reasons: visual clutter and long rendering time. 
% The existing researches mostly focus on visual clutter issues by developing advanced data aggregation and interaction techniques. 
Data sampling technique, an effective method in reducing the rendering time by shrinking the data size, has been applied in a variety of data. However, very few work target at the trajectory sampling especially from the perspective of visualization. The most commonly used sampling method, uniform random sampling technique, always generate results with very poor visual quality because very few trajectories located at margin regions can be preserved. We fill the gap by proposing a novel sampling techniques $\avats$
