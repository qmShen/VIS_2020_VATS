\section{Evaluation}
We first applied our approaches to several real-world dataset and compare our method with the uniform random sampling. Then we conduct several user studies on specific analysis tasks. 
\subsection{Experimental results}

Our first example uses

The images in the three columns indicate the visualization results for full dataset, proposed method, and uniform random sampling respectively. The visualizations in the first row shows the overview. The visualizations in the second the third row indicate the detail level visualization of region 1 and region 2. }
