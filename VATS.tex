\abstract{
%\QM{Line-based visualization has been widely used to present trajectory data. However, when the data size grows very large, it will take a considerable amount of time to render the graphics. Sampling techniques can mitigate the problem by directly shrinking the dataset, thus to reduce the rendering work of graphic devices. However, the traditional sampling techniques may lead to the loss of visual information and cannot directly be applied in line-based trajectory visualization. This work presents a novel approach, visual quality guaranteed sampling(VQGTS), specifically for the data reduction of large trajectory data visualization. We first propose a loss function to measure the visual quality loss between the visualization of the sub-dataset and the whole dataset. Then we minimize the loss function by transforming it as an optimization problem and propose efficient solutions. Several parameters and color encoding which can empower the effectiveness are discussed. The experiments on several large trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  The user study further shows the usability of our methods in the exploration of large trajectory data.}

%In this work, we present a novel sampling approach for line-based visualization of large trajectory data, targeting at maximizing the visual fidelity of sampled trajectory visualization.
%We introduce a new measurement of fidelity loss using pixel-oriented proximity between two visualization images.
%From the metric we formulate the sampling as an NP-hard optimization problem, and develop an efficient algorithm $-$ VFMS??, to approximate the optimal solution.
%VFMS encapsulates various control parameters including sampling rate and level of details (LODs), which complement with color coding to empower the effectiveness of trajectory visualization.
%We conduct a formal study to compare VFMS with state-of-the-art sampling methods on several large trajectory datasets.
%The experiments show that our approach improves visual fidelity by xxx\% (numbers?) meanwhile keeps computational efficiency.
%Qualitative user studies further demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in XXX (concrete applications?).}
% Visualizing large-scale trajectories is the core subroutine in many smart city applications, e.g., traffic management, route recommendation.
% However, it is very challenging as (i) the large trajectory data size, (ii) the limited rendering capability of graphics device, and (iii) visual clutter in data visualization.
% In this work, we propose a visual fidelity guaranteed sampling approach for large-scale line-based trajectory visualization.
% Specifically, we first define a novel fidelity loss function to capture the visual difference between two visualization results.
% We then prove that it is NP-hardness to select a sized-$k$ subset of trajectories with minimal visual fidelity loss.
% Next, we devise an approximate algorithm $\vats$ with a suite of optimization techniques, which returns visual fidelity quality guaranteed visualization result efficiently.
% Moreover, we further improve the visual effectiveness of $\vats$ by reduce visual clutter in large data visualization.%taking human perception ability and visual clutter issue into consideration.
% We conduct extensive experimental studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on real-world trajectory datasets.
% In addition, qualitative user studies further illustrate the superiority of our approach in various applications, e.g., region center identification, reachable route inspection, traffic flow comparison.

Visualizing large trajectory data surfers from limited rendering capability and visual clutter issues.
Sampling can effectively mitigate the issues, yet existing methods generally adopt random sampling strategy that has an attenuating effect on visual fidelity.
In this work, we propose a \QM{\textit{\textbf{visual fidelity guaranteed sampling}}} ($\avats$) algorithm for line-based visualization of large trajectory data.
